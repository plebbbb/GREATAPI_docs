# Introduction

Welcome to GREATAPI, a Vex Robotics library for the PROS API. 


# Installation

To install GREATAPI, head to our [releases page](https://github.com/plebbbb/GREATAPI/releases) and download the lastest GREATAPI@{something}.zip.

> Open up a console on the folder you've downloaded GREATAPI to, and enter the following command:

```console
prosv5 conduct fetch greatapi@[whatever version we are on].zip
```
From here, GREATAPI should be addable on the upgrade tab of the PROS editor. You may have to manually type in the name for it to be detected.

> If GREATAPI isn't there, open up a console in the directory of your PROs project(the folder with project.pros) and enter the following:

```console
prosv5 conduct apply greatapi
```
