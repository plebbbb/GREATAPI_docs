# Introduction

Welcome to GREATAPI, a Vex Robotics library for the PROS API. 


# Installation

> To install GREATAPI, head to our releases page: https://github.com/plebbbb/GREATAPI/releases and download the GREATAPI@[something] package.
> Next, open up a console on the folder you've downloaded GREATAPI to, and enter the following command:

```console
prosv5 conduct fetch greatapi@[whatever version we are on].zip
```
> From here, GREATAPI should be addable on the upgrade tab of the PROS editor. You may have to manually type in the name for it to be detected.
> If this isn't the case though, you can manually do it through console commands. Open up a console in the directory of your PROs project(the folder with project.pros).

```console
prosv5 conduct apply greatapi
```
